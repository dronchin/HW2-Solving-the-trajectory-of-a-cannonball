# HW2-Solving-the-trajectory-of-a-cannonball

This project involves different techniques used for solving the trajectory of a cannonball. It uses both Euler's method and the midpoint method for numerically solving a differential equation.

In the repository, you will find a python file for each one of 4 questions.

The work on this project was done by:
Nicolas Dronchi, Thomas Bertus, Joseph Slivka, and Siyu Zhou
